The LorenzRegression package proposes a toolbox to estimate, produce inference on and interpret Lorenz regressions. These regressions are used to determine the explanatory power of a set of covariates on the inequality of a response variable.

## Installation

You can install the released version of LorenzRegression from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("LorenzRegression")
```

You can install the development version of this package from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("AlJacq/LorenzRegression")
```

## What's new

### Version 2.0.0 (2024-08-01)

- **Breaking Changes**: 
  - The package structure has been standardized and builds upon existing libraries. Please review the updated function documentation for current usage. 
  - `Lorenz.Reg`: The function structure has changed. It now acts as a wrapper for the fitting functions `Lorenz.GA`, `Lorenz.FABS`and `Lorenz.SCADFABS`. It returns an object of class `''LR''` (non-penalized regression) or `''PLR''` (penalized regression). Each class has a set of designated methods.
  - `Lorenz.boot`: This function performs bootstrap calculations for objects of class `''LR''` or `''PLR''`. It uses the `boot` function from the `boot` package. For penalized regression, it also computes an out-of-bag score for tuning parameter selection. The function returns the updated object with bootstrap results and adds the class `''LR_boot''` (non-penalized regression) or `''PLR_boot''` (penalized regression).
  - `PLR.CV`: This function performs cross-validation for objects of class `''PLR''`. It computes a cross-validation score for tuning parameter selection. The folds are constructed using `vfold_cv` from the `rsample` package. The function returns the updated object with cross-validation results and adds the class `''PLR_cv''`.
  - Method availability for classes `''LR''` and `''PLR''` is now documented in the `Lorenz.Reg` help page. Each method also has its own help page.
  
- **New Features**:
  - The `grid.arg` and `grid.value` arguments in `Lorenz.Reg` allow users to specify one tuning parameter for penalized regression and construct a grid for it. Fitting is repeated for each grid value, and optimal values are determined using available methods (among BIC, bootstrap and cross-validation).
  - `diagnostic.PLR` provides diagnostic information for penalized Lorenz regression.
  
  
### Version 2.1.0 (2024-09-05)

- **Important changes**:
  - Methods were introduced for classes `"LR_boot"`, `"PLR_boot"` and `"PLR_cv"`. This induced modifications in the internal structure of those methods in order to align better with standard practices.
  - The output of methods for the class `"PLR"` were modified to align better with user experience.
  - Modifications occurred in `Lorenz.GA` (and the underlying Rcpp functions) in order to ensure full reproducibility of results.
  - Functions implying randomness have a `seed` argument. This argument sets a local seed, used for the generation of random objects within the function. the seed is reverted to its previous state after the operation. This ensures that the seed settings do not interfere with the global random state or other parts of the code.

- **New Features**:
  - Methods `ineqExplained`, `fitted` and `autoplot` for classes `"LR"` and `"PLR"`
