For pure health inequality (as measured by the Gini coefficient) and income-related health inequality (as measured by the concentration index), we show how measures derived from longitudinal data can be related to cross section Gini and concentration indices that have been typically reported in the literature to date, along with measures of health mobility inspired by the literature on income mobility. We also show how these measures of mobility can be usefully decomposed into the contributions of different factors. We apply these methods to investigate the degree of income-related mobility in the GHQ measure of psychological well-being in the first nine waves of the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS). This reveals that dynamics increase the absolute value of the concentration index of GHQ on income by 15\%, or 1.7\% per year on average, for men, and 5\%, or 0.6\% per year, for women.

  abstract = {This paper provides new evidence on the sources of differences in the degree of income-related inequalities in self-assessed health in 13 European Union member states. It goes beyond earlier work by measuring health using an interval regression approach to compute concentration indices and by decomposing inequality into its determining factors. New and more comparable data were used, taken from the 1996 wave of the European Community Household Panel. Significant inequalities in health (utility) favouring the higher income groups emerge in all countries, but are particularly high in Portugal and \textemdash{} to a lesser extent \textemdash{} in the UK and in Denmark. By contrast, relatively low health inequality is observed in the Netherlands and Germany, and also in Italy, Belgium, Spain Austria and Ireland. There is a positive correlation with income inequality per se but the relationship is weaker than in previous research. Health inequality is not merely a reflection of income inequality. A decomposition analysis shows that the (partial) income elasticities of the explanatory variables are generally more important than their unequal distribution by income in explaining the cross-country differences in income-related health inequality. Especially the relative health and income position of non-working Europeans like the retired and disabled explains a great deal of `excess inequality'. We also find a substantial contribution of regional health disparities to socio-economic inequalities, primarily in the Southern European countries.

  abstract = {This paper presents new international comparative evidence on the factors driving inequalities in the use of GP and specialist services in 12 EU member states. The data are taken from the 1996 wave of the European Community Household Panel (ECHP). We examine two types of utilisation (the probability of a visit and the conditional number of positive visits) for two types of medical care: general practitioner and medical specialist visits using probit, truncated Negbin and generalised Negbin models. We find little or no evidence of income-related inequity in the probability of a GP visit in these countries. Conditional upon at least one visit, there is even evidence of a somewhat pro-poor distribution. By contrast, substantial pro-rich inequity emerges in virtually every country with respect to the probability of contacting a medical specialist. Despite their lower needs for such care, wealthier and higher educated individuals appear to be much more likely to see a specialist than the less well-off. This phenomenon is universal in Europe, but stronger in countries where either private insurance cover or private practice options are offered to purchase quicker and/or preferential access. Pro-rich inequity in subsequent visits adds to this access inequity but appears more related to regional disparities in utilisation than to other factors. Despite decades of universal and fairly comprehensive coverage in European countries, utilisation patterns suggest that rich and poor are not treated equally.

  abstract = {This paper develops and estimates an overlapping generations general equilibrium model of labor earnings, skill formation, and physical capital accumulation with heterogenous human capital. The model analyzes both schooling choices and post-school on-the-job investment in skills in a framework in which different schooling levels index different skills. A key insight in the model is that accounting for the distinction between skill prices and measured wages is important for analyzing the changing wage structure, as they sometimes move in different directions. New methods for estimating the demand for unobserved human capital and for determining the substitution relationships between skills and capital in aggregate technology are developed and applied. We estimate skill-specific human capital accumulation equations that are consistent with the general equilibrium predictions of the model. Using our estimates, we find that a model of skill-biased technical change with a trend estimated from our aggregate technology is consistent with the central feature of rising wage inequality measured by the college\textendash{}high school wage differential and by the standard deviation of log earnings over the past 15 years. Immigration of low-skill workers contributes little to rising wage inequality. When the model is extended to account for the enlarged cohorts of the Baby Boom, we find that the same parameter estimates of the supply functions for human capital that are used to explain the wage history of the last 15 years also explain the last 35 years of wage inequality as documented by Katz and Murphy (L.

  abstract = {Standard methods for estimating empirical models in economics and many other fields rely on strong assumptions about functional forms and the distributions of unobserved random variables. Often, it is assumed that functions of interest are linear or that unobserved random variables are normally distributed. Such assumptions simplify estimation and statistical inference but are rarely justified by economic theory or other a priori considerations. Inference based on convenient but incorrect assumptions about functional forms and distributions can be highly misleading. Nonparametric and semiparametric statistical methods provide a way to reduce the strength of the assumptions required for estimation and inference, thereby reducing the opportunities for obtaining misleading results. These methods are applicable to a wide variety of estimation problems in empirical economics and other fields, and they are being used in applied research with increasing frequency. The literature on nonparametric and semiparametric estimation is large and highly technical. This book presents the main ideas underlying a variety of nonparametric and semiparametric methods. It is accessible to graduate students and applied researchers who are familiar with econometric and statistical theory at the level taught in graduate-level courses in leading universities. The book emphasizes ideas instead of technical details and provides as intuitive an exposition as possible. Empirical examples illustrate the methods that are presented. This book updates and greatly expands the author's previous book on semiparametric methods in econometrics. Nearly half of the material is new. Joel L. Horowitz is the Charles E. and Emma H. Morrison Professor of Market Economics at Northwestern University. He is the author of over 100 journal articles and book chapters in econometrics and statistics, a winner of the Richard Stone prize in applied econometrics, a fellow of the Econometric Society and American Statistical Association, and a former co-editor of Econometrica.},

The estimators, based on sample analogues of the product moment representation of the average derivative, are constructed using nonparametric kernel estimators of the density of the regressors. Asymptotic normality is established using extensions of classical U-statistic theorems, and asymptotic bias is reduced through use of a higher-order kernel. Consistent estimators of the asymptotic variance-covariance matrices of the estimators are given, and a limited Monte Carlo simulation is used to study the practical performance of the procedures.},

  abstract = {Single-index modeling is widely applied in,for example,econometric studies as a compromise between too restrictive parametric models and flexible but hardly estimable purely nonparametric models. By such modeling the statistical analysis usually focuses on estimating the index coefficients. The average derivative estimator (ADE) of the index vector is based on the fact that the average gradient of a single index function f(x{$\top\beta$})f(x{$\top\beta$})f(x\^\{\textbackslash{}top\}\textbackslash{}beta) is proportional to the index vector {$\beta\beta\backslash$}beta. Unfortunately,a straightforward application of this idea meets the so-called ``curse of dimensionality'' problem if the dimensionality ddd of the model is larger than 2. However, prior information about the vector {$\beta\beta\backslash$}beta can be used for improving the quality of gradient estimation by extending the weighting kernel in a direction of small directional derivative. The method proposed in this paper consists of such iterative improvements of the original ADE. The whole procedure requires at most 2 lognlog‚Å°n\textbackslash{}log n iterations and the resulting estimator is n--{$\surd$}n\textbackslash{}sqrt\{n\}-consistent under relatively mild assumptions on the model independently of the dimensionality ddd.},

It is known that under general conditions these estimators have asymptotic normal distributions, but the asymptotic variances are difficult to find. Here we prove that the quantiles and the variances of the asymptotic distributions can be consistently estimated by the nonparametric bootstrap. We investigate the accuracy of inference based on the asymptotic approximation and the bootstrap, and provide bounds on the associated error. In the case of MRC and MR, the bound is a function of the sample size of order close to n\^(-1/6). The PDR estimators belong to a special subclass of rank estimators for which the bound is vanishing with the rate close to n\^(-1/2). The theoretical findings are illustrated with Monte-Carlo experiments and a real data example.},

It is expected that the results of multiple markers will need to be combined in order to yield adequately accurate classification. Typically, the objective function that is optimized for combining markers is the likelihood function. In this article, we consider an alternative objective function-the area under the empirical receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). We note that it yields consistent estimates of parameters in a generalized linear model for the risk score but does not require specifying the link function. Like logistic regression, it yields consistent estimation with case-control or cohort data. Simulation studies suggest that AUC-based classification scores have performance comparable with logistic likelihood-based scores when the logistic regression model holds. Analysis of data from a proteomics biomarker study shows that performance can be far superior to logistic regression derived scores when the logistic regression model does not hold. Model fitting by maximizing the AUC rather than the likelihood should be considered when the goal is to derive a marker combination score for classification or prediction.},

The final estimate is then obtained by a numerical inversion. Compared to the currently available techniques for monotone estimation the new method does not require constrained optimization. We prove asymptotic normality of the new estimate and compare the asymptotic properties with the unconstrained estimate. In particular, it is shown that for kernel estimates or local polynomials the bandwidths in the procedure can be chosen such that the monotone estimate is first-order asymptotically equivalent to the unconstrained estimate. We also illustrate the performance of the new procedure by means of a simulation study.},

  title = {Gini {{Simple Regressions}}},
  isbn = {978-1-4614-4720-7},
  abstract = {The basic building block in regression is the covariance between the dependent variable and the explanatory variable(s). There are two regression methods that can be interpreted as based on Gini's Mean Difference (GMD). The first method is based on the fact that one can present the Gini-covariance between the dependent variable and the explanatory variable as a weighted sum of slopes of the regression curve (a semi-parametric approach). The second method is based on the minimization of the GMD of the residuals. The semi-parametric approach is similar in its structure to the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method. That is, the regression coefficient in the OLS has an equivalent term in the Gini semi-parametric regression. The equivalent term is constructed by substituting the covariance and the variance in the OLS regression by the Gini-covariance (hereafter co-Gini) and the Gini, respectively. However, unlike the OLS, the Gini regression coefficient and its estimator are not derived by solving a minimization problem. Therefore they do not have optimality properties and cannot be described as ``the best,'' at least not with respect to a simple target function. On the other hand, the second method, the minimization of the GMD of the residuals implies optimality but it has its drawbacks. Like Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) and quantile regressions, the regression coefficient does not have an explicit presentation and can be calculated only numerically. The combination of the two methods of Gini regression enables the user to investigate the appropriateness of the assumptions that lie behind the OLS and Gini regressions (e.g., the linearity of the relationship) and therefore can improve the quality of the conclusions that are derived from them. Moreover, when dealing with a multiple regression one can combine the semi-parametric regression method with the OLS regression method. That is, several explanatory variables can be treated as in the OLS, while others are treated using the Gini method. This flexibility enables one to evaluate the effect of the choice of a regression method on the estimated coefficients in a gradual way by substituting the methodology of the estimation for each explanatory variable in a stepwise way rather than in an ``all or nothing'' way. This issue will be discussed in Chap. 8.},

In addition we present the relationships between the concepts of second-degree stochastic dominance and welfare dominance on one hand and the concentration and Lorenz curves on the other hand.

Drawing on vast data sets and cutting-edge research, he explains the benign and malign forces that make inequality rise and fall within and among nations. He also reveals who has been helped the most by globalization, who has been held back, and what policies might tilt the balance toward economic justice. Global Inequality takes us back hundreds of years, and as far around the world as data allow, to show that inequality moves in cycles, fueled by war and disease, technological disruption, access to education, and redistribution. The recent surge of inequality in the West has been driven by the revolution in technology, just as the Industrial Revolution drove inequality 150 years ago. But even as inequality has soared within nations, it has fallen dramatically among nations, as middle-class incomes in China and India have drawn closer to the stagnating incomes of the middle classes in the developed world. A more open migration policy would reduce global inequality even further. Both American and Chinese inequality seems well entrenched and self-reproducing, though it is difficult to predict if current trends will be derailed by emerging plutocracy, populism, or war. For those who want to understand how we got where we are, where we may be heading, and what policies might help reverse that course, Milanovic's compelling explanation is the ideal place to start.},
